	// Challenge is the identifier ("login challenge") of the login request. It is used to
	// identify the session.

	// RequestURL is the original OAuth 2.0 Authorization URL requested by the OAuth 2.0 client. It is the URL which
	// initiates the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code or OAuth 2.0 Implicit flow. This URL is typically not needed, but
	// might come in handy if you want to deal with additional request parameters.

	// this ID will remain the same. If the user-agent did not have an existing authentication session (e.g. remember is false)

	SessionID string `json:"session_id,omitempty"`

	// This feature allows you to update / set session information.
	Skip bool `json:"skip,omitempty"`

	// Subject is the user ID of the end-user that authenticated. Now, that end user needs to grant or deny the scope
	// requested by the OAuth 2.0 client. If this value is set and `skip` is true, you MUST include this subject type
	// when accepting the login request, or the request will fail.
