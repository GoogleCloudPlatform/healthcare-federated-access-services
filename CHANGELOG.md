**Highlight Updates**

* Added `client_secret` to ConfigTrustedIssuerRequest (DAM) and ConfigIdentityProviderRequest (IC) for secret rotation support

**Migration**

* SCIM endpoints path `/identity/scim/...` removed, so client migration to
  `/scim/...` must be complete in order to upgrade.

## [v0.9.10](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/healthcare-federated-access-services/tree/v0.9.10)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/healthcare-federated-access-services/compare/v0.9.9...v0.9.10)

**Migration**

* Remove any references to an "allowlist of realms" from DAM or IC configs as
  part of upgrading to this release. These options are no longer recognized and

  this infrastructure.

**Migration**

* Move `/identity/scim/...` endpoints to `/scim/...` endpoints (i.e. "scim" is
  at the path root).
  * **IMPORTANT**: applications should move to use the new paths as the
    older path endpoints will be removed shortly.
* localeMetadata endpoints now return UI objects with more information instead
  of strings as the values within the maps.
