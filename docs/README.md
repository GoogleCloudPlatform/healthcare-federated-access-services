## Categories of Documentation

Federated Access documentation is organized as follows:

   understanding of the problem and solution space for Federated Access.

1. **[Playground](playground/README.md#federated-access-playground)**: How to
   set up a test or tutorial environment and interact with these systems using
   GA4GH Passports and Visas.

1. **[Identity Concentrator](ic/README.md#identity-concentrator)** (IC): Develop
   an understanding of the Passport Broker component included in this
   repository.

1. **[Data Access Manager](dam/README.md#data-access-manager)** (DAM): Develop
   an understanding of the Passport Clearinghouse component included in this
   respository.

1. **[Shared Documentation](shared/README.md#shared-documentation)**:
   Documentation that is shared between the IC and the DAM as they have some
   functionality in common.

## GA4GH Links

1. **Open Standards** used by these components:
   *  **[GA4GH Passports](https://bit.ly/ga4gh-passport-v1)**: The format of
      identity and authorization information as GA4GH Passports and GA4GH Visas.
   *  **[GA4GH AAI](https://bit.ly/ga4gh-aai-profile)**: The token mechanisms
      employed by Passports and Visas as a particular flavor of OIDC.
      *  **[OIDC](https://bit.ly/oidc-spec-v1)** (OpenID Connect): The
         underlying discovery and claim specification used by Passports.
      *  **[OAuth 2.0](https://bit.ly/oauth-spec-v2)**: The token layer
         leveraged by OIDC.
      *  **[JWT](https://bit.ly/jwt-spec-draft)**: The generic JSON Web Token
         (JWT) format that GA4GH AAI specifies for use with GA4GH tokens, and
         thereby this format spec governs Passports and Visas.

1. **Webinars** that provide background about Passports:
   *  **[GA4GH Passports Webinar 1](https://bit.ly/ga4gh-passports-webinar)**:
      Benefits of Integrating Global Electronic ID for Accessing Biomedical Data
      ([slides](https://bit.ly/ga4gh-passports-slides1)).
   *  **[GA4GH Passports Webinar 2](https://bit.ly/ga4gh-passports-webinar2)**:
      Implementing GA4GH Passports & AAI Technical Deep Dive
      ([slides](https://bit.ly/ga4gh-passports-slides2)).

1. **External Tools** available for Passports:
   *  **[ELIXIR Passport Echo Service](https://echo.aai.elixir-czech.org/)**:
      Log into ELIXIR AAI and view passport details. [source
      code](https://github.com/ICS-MU/ga4gh-passport-tester).
